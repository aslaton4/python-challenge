# PyBank Analysis
### I completed a financial analysis on a dataset that tracks monthly profit and loss over an 86-month period. The analysis provided insights into the total performance of the company over the analyzed period, including metrics such as total profits, monthly changes, and notable periods of financial fluctuation.

### Total Months:
- The dataset covers a span of 86 months, which allows us to review the company's performance over multiple years.

### Net Total Profit/Losses:
- The total net profit over the entire period is $22,564,198. This figure represents the cumulative profit or loss after summing up all monthly profit/loss values.

### Average Change in Profit/Losses:
- The average monthly change in profits is $-8,311.11. This negative figure suggests that, on average, the company experienced a small monthly decline in profits over the entire period. This indicates some instability or losses during certain periods.

### Greatest Increase in Profits:
- The month with the greatest increase in profits occurred in August 2016, with an increase of $1,862,002. This spike could be attributed to a significant positive event or market condition that drastically boosted company revenue during that period.

### Greatest Decrease in Profits:
- The month with the greatest decrease in profits occurred in February 2014, with a loss of $1,825,558. This suggests a significant downturn during that period, which may have been caused by an external factor such as a market crash or internal issues within the company.

## Takeaways:
### The negative average change of $-8,311.11 each month reflects an inconsistent performance even with a total profit of $22.5 million over the timespan. With the extensive fluctuations noted through the substantial fluctuations between increases and decreases in certain months, it leads to a conclusion that the business overall is volatile. 

### The high volatility noted would lead to further analysis of this data to be performed so as to understand the underlying cause. 

### Overall my review of this analysis seems to suggest that even though the company overall was profitable, it faces periods of instability. And I would recommend that a deeper investigation be completed to allow for identification of factors that influenced the negative periods of performance. 


# PyPoll Analayis
### I completed an analysis that reviews election results based on the data provided in the CSV file, which includes voter information such as Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 

### The purpose of the analysis was to determine the following key metrics:
- Total number of votes cast: The analysis counted all unique votes to find a total of 369,711 votes cast during the election.
- Candidates who received votes: Three candidates received votes in this election: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anthony Doane.
- Percentage and total votes each candidate received:
    - Diana DeGette received 73.812% of the vote, with 272,892 total votes.
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.049% of the vote, with 85,213 total votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.139% of the vote, with 11,606 total votes.
- Winner: Based on the popular vote, Diana DeGette won the election with a clear majority of 73.812% of the total votes.

### The script generated a detailed report, both in the terminal and a text file, that summarizes these statistics, and identified Diana DeGette as the winner based on the highest vote count.
